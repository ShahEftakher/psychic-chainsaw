# Chapter 1

He sailed through the ocean of 1's and 0's with only Arrays till now. He had barely any knowledge about the vast fleet of DS, that could be at his disposal. He could be the general of 7 Sea's. But now all he has a raft. He started his journey with a raft made of Array and basic loops. This might be enough for the shallow water for now, but soon he'll be in deep waters. He needs to hurry. 

The very first upgrade he got was like a sail to his bare raft. This means more speed. He fell in love with this unsorted indisciplined DS. It may be indiscipline, it could get the job done. Like him. He could get the job done, but he'd need cleaner strokes to conserve his energy, this will be a long journey. If he wants to survive he'll need all the help he could get and Hashmap was a perfect tool for him. He soon made his way into deeper water with a bare raft and a sail.
